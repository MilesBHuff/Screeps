Code of Conduct
################################################################################
| A project code of conduct is an unnecessary thing, and laymen should not try
  to do a lawyer's job.  Please refer to all existing local laws and regulations
  regarding proper interpersonal conduct.
| The core of any code of conduct, though, can be summarized with the following:
  **Do not perform *ad-hominems***.
| Additionally, as with any academic endeavour, it is important to **avoid
  logical fallacies**.
| Naught more need be said.
